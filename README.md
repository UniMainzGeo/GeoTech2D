# GeoTech2D

This contains the source code of `GeoTech2D` which is a 2D unstructured finite element code for geomechanical applications with visco-elasto-viscoplastic material properties and mode-I and mode-II regularized plasticity. It employs LBB-stable Crouzeix-Raviart triangular elements using a mixed displacement and pressure increment formulation.

The code and the numerical formulation to solve problems with combined mode-I/mode-II plasticity models in a robust manner is described in detail in:
